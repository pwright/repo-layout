At the core of each website are files that use a list metaphor to define mindmaps:

* Only one item can be at the center of a mindmap, the 'root' node.
* Each level of the list creates a branch in the mindmap rendering.
* Use the `left` keyword to populate the 'west' side of the map.

For example

----
include::practice.uml[]
----

For more information about the list format see link:https://plantuml.com/mindmap-diagram[PlantUML].

When embedded in AsciiDoc, this format needs a server to create the image file.
To run your own server, see https://github.com/yuzutech/kroki[kroki].

The AsciiDoc files are rendered to HTML using link:https://docs.antora.org/[Antora].
